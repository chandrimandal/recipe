        <ul>
            <li class="list_item method Chicken_65">For the marination, take a bowl and mix chilli powder, coriander powder, 
                turmeric powder, curd and salt together. This marination step is very 
                important and will give this chicken recipe real flavour.</li>
            <li class="list_item method Chicken_65">Now, wash the chicken in cold running water and chop it. Once it is done, 
                add the chicken pieces in the above mixture and marinate them. Once the 
                chicken pieces are well coated, keep them aside for 4-6 hours so that 
                flavours are well absorbed.</li>
            <li class="list_item method Chicken_65">Now, take a deep-bottomed pan and heat oil in it over moderate flame. 
                Once the oil is sufficiently hot, carefully put the marinated chicken 
                pieces in the oil and shallow fry them till cooked or golden from both 
                the sides.</li>
            <li class="list_item method Chicken_65">Now, remove and cook the chicken pieces in a separate pan without oil 
                over low flame. This step will make the chicken more crispy. Once done, 
                add the green chillies, curry leaves and ketchup. Mix well till the chicken 
                pieces are well coated and continue to cook over medium heat for 5-6 minutes. 
                Transfer the dish in a serving bowl.</li>
            <li class="list_item method Chicken_65">Chicken 65 is ready. Serve as a snack or with roti and chappatis.</li>
        </ul>
